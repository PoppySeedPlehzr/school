Programs within this directory are executed as specified in the project document wherein
specific directions for AES Counter Mode are stated.

The project document also contains the analysis of this mode of operation. 

Executing these programs with no parameters will cause text defining the usage to
be printed.  Ie.,

./keygen
./encrypt
./decrypt

All of these programs DO NOT utilize a fixed output file.  The output goes to
stdout by default and may be redirected.  Error messages and timing data, if
selected, goes to stderr.
