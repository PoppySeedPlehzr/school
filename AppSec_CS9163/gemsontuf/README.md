Gems on TUF
=========

This project is an implementation of Ruby's Gem updater service using TUF (The Update Framework).<br />
The goal is to add a robust layer of security to the rubygems service, by utilizing TUF.<br />
This implementation is achieved by writing a bridge using the C modules from Ruby in order to communicate with the Python modules of TUF.
