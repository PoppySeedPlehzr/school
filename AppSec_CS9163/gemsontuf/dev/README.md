Developers'
=========

You shouldn't be here, ... or should you be? <br />
This directory contains ideas for code, works in progress, and code that is no longer used. <br />
This directory exists to hold our ideas past and present, but it is NOT required in any way to run gemsontuf.

There is no guarantee anything in here works the way one would expect. <br />

FYI, code worth noting:
- ./attackscripts/ contains scripts for creating malicious repositories, used to simulate attacks.
- ./proxy/ contains an early implementation of gemsontuf using a local proxy to intercept requests from rubygems client.
- ./scratchscratch/ contains even earlier code, incl. first implementations of the C bridge, a direct Ruby to Python implementation, etc
